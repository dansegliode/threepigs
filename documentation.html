			<h2>audience</h2>
			<p class="docP">Children, Parents, Teachers <br>
				People surfin' the Net<br>
				Reading time in class</p>

			<h2>goal</h2>
			<p class="docP">To tell the story of the three little pigs through interactive graphics.</p>
			<p class="docP">Design goals include contrasting scenes to represent good and evil,
				using a simple approach to graphics using basic geometry children are familiar with, and
				having users use mouse scrolling, dragging and clicking as interactions.</p>

			<h2>wireframes</h2>
			<p class="docP">Our wireframes/sketches can be found <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/a8yjODV1ZN8QCWT9Ujlm5igy/three-little-pigs?node-id=0%3A1">here</a></p>

			<h2>design</h2>
			<p class="docP">Many of our design decisions were based on the fact that this is meant for a wide range of ages,
				including children. Simple geometry and a simple, bright color palette conveys the elements so they are easy to
				understand. We also wanted to create a story
				book feel with a serif text, yet add a sense of sophistication with a clean layout and slow fading of elements.
			</p>
			<p class="docP">Our interaction design includes clicking, scrolling, and dragging. We wanted to make the
				interactions relatively intuitive so the story would be easy to follow.
			</p>

			<h2>above & beyond</h2>
			<p class="docP">To go above and beyond what we learned in class we created our own drag and drop feature by using the offsets of specific DOM elements and setting those equal to the cursor. Then using on drag, drag start, and drag end we timed different events to happen on different stages of an interaction. We used animations like scaling when picking up an item and placing it and radar to indicate an action
				being completed to customize it further. Within the drag and
				drop feature we implemented collision detection and snapping into place.
			</p>
			<p class="docP">Making sure there were no errors in the drag and drop took a lot of our efforts. Checking targets,
				making sure you can't drag an element once placed, and avoiding other errors we encountered by testing were
				challenges we faced.
				A lot of new things we learned and implemented actually came from trying to get around the errors we got- since we
				needed to increase specificity to get it to work properly, we had to look into things we weren't familiar with.
			</p>

			<h2>responsibilities</h2>
			<p class="docP">We worked on our wireframes/sketches in the same figma document. Andrew implemented the drag and
				drop feature, the radar effect, and the animation for the wolf hitting the wall. Sarah implemented page fading,
				collision detection, the
				scatter animation, and created the landing and docs page. We also both helped fix issues in each other's code along
				the way.
